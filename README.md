# spoofAugment

Spoof Augmentations code for "Wavelet-CNN-based end-to-end audio deepfake detection for channel-mismatched scenario". 
As mentioned in the paper, this repository provides a curated battery of audio augmentations designed to mimic artefacts introduced by several speech generative models used for audio spoofing.

Random visualization of some of the spoof augmentations applied on a single original bonafide audio:
